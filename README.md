## Steel
**Nucor** benefited from tariffs, showing relatively stable or improving returns post-announcement. The fall post-election can be attributed to a combination of factors, including:
   - declining steel demand due to softening demand in key sectors like automotive.
   - increasing imports due to uncertainty around tariff policies under the new administration.

Volatility rose steadily, reflecting heightened uncertainty and pricing pressures in the steel market.



## Aluminum
**Alcoa** likely faced challenged tied to tariff complexities. Aluminum producers face difficulties due to insufficient US domestic production and counterproductive tariffs on Canadian imports, Canada being a major aluminum supplier.
  - After tariff announcement, slight decline indicating market hesitation about the direct benefits of tariffs on aluminum, especially with complexities around imports from Canada
  - Further price decline suggests that tariffs introduced additional costs and uncertainties, outweighing potential benefits

  - The slight recovery post-implementation suggests some stabilization and market adjustment to the new trade environement
  - Overall, tariffs added financial strain to automakers reliant on these materials.
