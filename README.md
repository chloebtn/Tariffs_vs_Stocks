Tariffs had a mixed impact on the stock market:
1. **Nucor** (Steel) benefited from tariffs, showing relatively stable or improving returns post-announcement. The fall post-election can be attributed to a combination of factors, including:
   - declining steel demand due to softening demand in key sectors like automotive.
   - increasing imports due to uncertainty around tariff policies under the new administration.

Nucor closing price before election: 148.95

Nucor closing price after tariff announcement: 135.31

Nucor closing price after tariff implementation: 130.76

  - After tariff announcement the slight decline indicate market hesitation about the direct benefits of tariffs on aluminum, especially with complexities around imports from Canada
  - Further price decline suggest that tariffs introduced additional costs and uncertainties, outweighing potential benefits

Ford closing price after tariff announcement: 9.28

  - Decline after tariff anouncement highlights the negative impact of increased input costs due to tariffs on steel and aluminum.
